    "### Background:\n",
    "   Geert Hofstede is a Dutch social psychologist who performed research on cross-culture groups and consequently, how national culture permeates and affects systems and organizations. In his book *Masculinity and Femininity: The Taboo Dimension of National Cultures*, he posits that countries fall on the spectrum of either having a masculine culture or a feminine one.\n",
    "    \n",
    "   His definition of culture in this study is more focused on “...broad patterns of thinking, feeling and acting…” (Hofstede et al. 5) and argue that these traits are deep-seated and are unlikely to change. On his ranking, the Nordic countries, comprised of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Sweden, Norway, Greenland and the Faroe Islands, all rank as feminine, while the United States rank as being masculine. "

      "A number of studies have focused on the interaction between leadership, \n",

      "there is a specific Nordic leadership style. Features of this include delegation of \n",
      "power and responsibility to employees, as well as a high degree of consensus \n",
      "seeking where every employeeÕs voice is important. A Nordic leader also \n",
      "stresses the necessity of co-operation. In addition, he or she plays down their \n",
      "authority and often functions more as a coach for their employees. It is also \n",
      "important that the leader is able to inspire their employees and be visionary \n",
      "yet realistic at the same time. \n",
      "Nordic companies have a leadership culture that generally gives rise to more \n",

      "that generates a good breeding ground for creativity. It has also created \n",
      "a symbiosis between employees and companies, where both sides have an \n",
      "instinctive awareness of each otherÕs importance and take responsibility for \n",
      "the whole. \n",
      "Studies have identified the Middle East and Sub-Saharan Africa as most \n",

      "Eastern Europe is the most different, while Latin America and the Anglo- \n",
      "Saxon world are identified as having leadership styles that lie fairly close to \n",
      "the Nordic one. \n",
      "How did the Nordic leadership style emerge? If you take a closer look at the \n",
      "development of societies in the Nordic region during the early 20th century, \n",
      "compromises and a desire to balance various interests within society stand \n",
      "out as a common thread across the Nordic countries. It can be said that the \n",
      "Nordic societies aimed to reach pivot points between actors with almost \n",
      "opposing interests, especially in the labour market. The probable consequences \n",
      "of this are that the leadership role does not have the same status as in many \n",
      "other countries, and that the leader functions as a coach for their employees, \n",
      "rather than an authoritative autocrat. Even aspects such as consensus and \n",
      "co-operation, which have been identified as important features for Nordic \n",
      "leadership, can be connected to this. In all probability, it is these aspects that \n",
      "allow the high levels of accountability we can see within the organisations. \n",
      "The Nordic leadership style also has a background in the Nordic welfare state. \n",
      "The early industrial paternalistic relationship between employers and workers \n",
      "in the Nordic countries started to relax a bit into the 20th century, and was \n",
      "essentially replaced with a relationship between the employee and the welfare \n",
      "state. It has been noted that the Nordic welfare model has a strong dimension \n",
      "of individuality. On a deeper level, individuality in this context means that the \n",
      "individual (employee) is not heavily dependent on the employer. A Nordic leader \n",
      "must therefore not expect their employees to consider themselves as strongly \n",
      "dependent on either the employer or workplace. This is probably a driving force \n",
      "behind aspects such as the flat organisational structure. \n",
      "The Nordic countries also have small and open economies. They are also \n",
      "knowledge-intensive, and exporting economies with a position at the forefront \n",
      "of technological development. This has created a need for adaptability. It also \n",

      "9 \n",
      "means that employees have a high level of education and strong identity in \n",
      "the work they perform. One consequence of this is flexibility in the face of \n",
      "change, where the leader is responsible for providing a long-term direction for \n",
      "the almost autonomous employees. \n",
      "It is not difficult to recognize that the Nordic leadership style has significant \n",
      "value due to its ability to create conditions for high productivity, innovation \n",
      "and growth, while also providing high levels of satisfaction for employees \n",
      "and a good working environment. One researcher believes that discussing a \n",
      "specific Nordic leadership model is significant because of its aim to combine \n",
      "economic growth with democratic stability. This is a description that appears \n",
      "to make good sense. \n",
      "Criticism against the Nordic leadership style also exists, including that it \n",
      "is perceived as being close to the concept of Ôleaderless democracyÕ, where \n",
      "decisions are made in other locations within the organisation or are perceived \n",
      "as ÔgivenÕ. Instead, leadership almost exclusively concerns administration and \n",
      "HR issues. \n",
      "We are currently experiencing a technological shift that could essentially \n",
      "change society, the economy, the conditions for business activities, work \n",
      "organisation and leadership. Finally, the report discusses some themes that \n",
      "are significant for the future of the Nordic leadership style Ð stakeholder \n",
      "perspective, ethics and education. \n",
      "In the Nordic region, companies have a closer and more symbiotic relationship \n",
      "with the surrounding society, particularly compared with American companies. \n",
      "This includes a different approach to accountability, not least in relation to \n",
      "maintaining relationships with stakeholders. These stakeholders can comprise \n",
      "different types. They could include, for example, employees, customers and \n",
      "suppliers, as well as trade unions, volunteer organisations and individuals who \n",
      "may live near the company. You could say that Nordic companies do not limit \n",
      "their corporate social responsibility to financial profit, but consider a much \n",
      "wider perspective. \n",
      "The core of the Nordic leadership style consists of several different ethical \n",
      "considerations, such as how democracy, human dignity, responsibility, \n",
      "obligations, rights and the individualÕs role in relation to the community are \n",
      "viewed for example. Promoting a long-term ethical dimension in the Nordic \n",
      "leadership style can be equated to supporting the central core values in our \n",
      "society. The values that have guided leadership issues in the Nordic region \n",
      "to date relate specifically to openness, integrity and trust. \n",
      "Education is the key to the Nordic leadership style in many ways. Employees \n",
      "can be flexible thanks to further education, enabling them to take a lot \n",
      "of responsibility within the organisations. Education is also crucial from \n",
      "another perspective, namely that future leaders at universities and colleges \n",

      "that the relationship between the employee and the owner of the factory \n",
      "or company was personal and comprised more than just work. In exchange \n",
      "for loyalty to factory owners, the employee (generally including their family) \n",
      "received lifelong security, which could include accommodation, healthcare, \n",
      "child care and more. This created a kind of paternal relationship between the \n",
      "employee and leadership. The flip side of this was high dependency on the \n",
      "owners, which was often accompanied by low wages. The driving force of the \n",

      "often incorporated into what is called the second industrial revolution. \n",

      "In brief, the Nordic leadership style can be described as having a high degree of \n",
      "delegation of power and responsibility in flat organisations where the leader \n",
      "encourages co-operation. In addition, the Nordic region has less formality, \n",
      "accompanied by a high degree of informal rules and procedures. The leader \n",
      "functions as a kind of coach, and inspires and motivates employees rather than \n",
      "stressing their authority. He or she must listen to all employees in connection \n",
      "with making and implementing decisions. It is also important to have the \n",
      "courage to take risks and also take responsibility if things go wrong, i.e. not be \n",
      "worried about Ôlosing faceÕ in a professional context. \n",
      "If you take a closer look at the development of societies in the Nordic region \n",
      "during the early 20th century, the compromises and desire to balance various \n",
      "interests of society stand out as a prevalent feature. The Nordic societies can \n",
      "be considered to have aimed to find pivot points between players with almost \n",
      "opposing interests, especially on the labour market, where the parties involved \n",
      "are given a central responsibility. The text also identifies corporate governance of \n",
      "companies as another area where the Nordic region has achieved a somewhat \n",
      "different balance of interests compared with the rest of the world. The CEO and \n",
      "other leadership for companies in the Nordic region, for example, have been given \n",
      "a role that focuses more on internal relationships Ð with more limited power than \n",
      "in other countries. The total consequences of this are likely to be that the leaderÕs \n",
      "role does not have the same status as in many other countries, and that the \n",
      "leader functions as a coach for their employees, who are essentially autonomous. \n",
      "The aim to find a balance can also be connected to concepts such as consensus \n",
      "and co-operation, which have been identified as important features of Nordic \n",
      "leadership. In all probability, it is from these aspects we can derive the high \n",
      "levels of accountability and trust that we can see within the organisations. \n",
      "Another aspect is the creation of the welfare state in the Nordic region. The \n",
      "early paternalistic relationship between employers and employees started to \n",
      "relax a bit into the 20th century and was replaced with a relationship between \n",
      "the employee and the welfare state. It has been noted that the Nordic welfare \n",
      "model has a strong dimension of individuality. (In some of the reported studies, \n",
      "we could also see a complex relationship between individualism and collectivism \n",
      "in the Nordic countries.) This probably also had an influence on the leadership \n",
      "style. The fact that employees do not consider themselves dependent on the \n",
      "employer, in the same way as in the rest of the world, is a driving force behind \n",
      "the ÔflatÕ organisation structure. It also strengthens the image of the leader as \n",
      "non-authoritarian. \n",
      "A third aspect concerns the industrial structure. If you place the initial industrial \n",
      "breakthrough in the Nordic countries at around the end of the 19th century, \n",
      "it is already possible to note some of the elements in this early phase that \n",
      "subsequently came to distinguish the industrial structure in the Nordic countries \n",
      "right up to the present day. The Nordic region consists of relatively small and \n",
      "open economies close to the global markets. They are also knowledge-intensive \n",

      "Firstly, companies in the Nordic societies play a different role in comparison to \n",
      "large parts of the world, especially in comparison with American companies. In \n",
      "the Nordic countries, companies have a closer and more symbiotic relationship \n",
      "to the surrounding society than their American counterparts. This essentially \n",
      "includes a different view of responsibility. The companyÕs responsibility can \n",
      "be described in different ways, but a common thread is maintaining good \n",
      "relationships with stakeholders. These stakeholders can comprise different \n",
      "types. Some have a strong influence, and can even be crucial to the companyÕs \n",
      "survival. These include, for example, employees, customers and suppliers. Others \n",
      "may have more general influence and are found amongst the media, authorities, \n",
      "trade unions and local residents. For Nordic companies, it is important to create \n",
      "trusting relationships with stakeholders. If these relationships deteriorate or \n",
      "are weakened, continued development of the company is compromised. In this \n",
      "context, you can compare the American and Nordic perspectives by referring \n",
      "to the American economist Milton FriedmanÕs famous statement that Òthe \n",
      "business of business is businessÓ. For an American company, its most important \n",
      "corporate and social responsibility is to make a profit. \n",
      "Secondly, there is an ethical dimension at the core of the Nordic leadership \n",
      "style. This is due to the in-depth considerations on how we look at, for \n",
      "example, democracy, human dignity, responsibility, obligations, rights, the \n",
      "individualÕs role in relation to the community, etc. Promoting a long-term \n",

      "Power distance The degree to which less influential members \n",

      "stands for a preference for co-operation, modesty, \n",
      "care of the weak and quality of life. These opposing \n",
      "pairs can also be described such that society, in the \n",
      "first case, is more inclined to competition or, in the \n",
      "second case, is more oriented to consensus. \n",
      "Individualism vs collectivism Individualism can be defined as a preference for \n",
      "a social framework within which individuals are \n",
      "only expected to take care of themselves and their \n",
      "immediate family. In contrast to this definition of \n",
      "individualism, collectivism represents a preference \n",

      "within this network look after one another, and \n",
      "are unconditionally loyal to the members of the \n",

      "The American system of government, begun as an experiment in liberty and democracy in 1776, has proven to be remarkably resilient and adaptable.\n",
      "   While often categorized as a  democracy, the United States  is  more  accurately  deﬁned as a constitutional federal republic. What does this mean? “Constitutional” refers to the fact that government in the United States is based on a Constitution which is the supreme law of the United States. The Constitution not only provides the framework for how the  federal and state  governments  are  structured,  but also places signiﬁcant limits on their powers. “Federal” means that there is both a national\n",
      " government and governments of the 50 states. A “republic” is a form of government in which the people hold power, but elect representa- tives to exercise that power.\n",

      "UNDERSTANDING HOW THE AMERICAN SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT OPERATES\n",
      "To a visiting observer, the U.S. government may seem straightforward: the Congress makes the laws and the President  implements  them.  A  closer  inspection  reveals  a much more complex system of interactions and inﬂuences.\n",
      "   As a republic, the ultimate power within the American system rests with the people. This power is exercised through regular, scheduled elections in which voters select the President, members of Congress, and various state and local ofﬁcials. These ofﬁcials and their staffs formulate policy, make laws, and direct the day-to-day operations of government.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "   The U.S. Constitution is the blueprint for the American system of government. Ratiﬁed in 1788, the Constitution deﬁnes three separate branches of government (legislative, executive, and judicial), their powers, and how positions in each are to be ﬁlled.\n",
      "    One deﬁning characteristic of the Constitution is the system of checks and balances it created to distribute power among the three branches.\n",
      "Each branch exercises some form of power over the others. For example, justices\n",
      "of the Supreme\n",
      "Court (judiciary) are appointed by the President (executive), but subject to the consent of the U.S. Senate (legislative). Likewise, the judiciary  can  strike  down as unconstitutional laws passed by Con- gress and signed by the President. These and other checks and  balances  ensure that no single branch of government exercises too much power.\n",
      "   Because the government may ex- ercise only those powers specifically granted to it in the Constitution, the Constitution is an important  protection of the rights and powers of the people. The first ten amendments to the Consti- tution are collectively known as the Bill\n",
      "\n",
      "of Rights. The Bill of Rights guarantees important freedoms to every American, including freedom of speech, press, and religion, and the right to be free from unreasonable searches, and to have a trial by jury.\n",
      "The Constitution, as the supreme law\n",
      "of the land, limits the legislative and ex- ecutive powers of all levels of government. Any law or portion of a law that is deemed by the courts to be\n",
      "in conﬂict with the Constitution is nulliﬁed, with the U.S. Supreme Court having the ﬁnal\n",
      "say in such matters.\n",
      "   Amend- ments to the Constitution are adopted when pro- posed by two-thirds of the House and Senate\n",
      "and ratiﬁed by three-fourths of the states. This is a difﬁcult process, with only 27 amendments having been made since the Constitution was ratiﬁed. Of these, only 16 have been adopted since 1800.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "   The Constitution not only deﬁnes the structure and powers of the federal government, but also contains general provisions regarding state government. Each state, in turn, has its own constitution which contains provisions for local governments within the state. Local governments may include cities, counties, towns, school districts, and special-purpose districts, which govern such matters as local natural resources or transportation networks.\n",
      "   The federal government is limited  to the powers and responsibilities  speciﬁ- cally granted to it by  the  U.S.  Constitu- tion. Some of the powers listed in the Constitution include regulating commerce between the states, providing for national defense, creating money, regulating im- migration and naturalization, and entering into treaties with foreign countries.\n",
      "   Over time, however, the Constitution has been interpreted and amended to adapt to changing circumstances, and the powers exercised by the federal govern- ment have changed with it. Working with the states, the federal government cre-\n",
      "\n",
      "ates certain laws and programs that are funded federally, but administered by the states. Education, social welfare, assisted housing and nutrition, homeland security, transportation, and emergency response are key areas where states deliver services using federal funds and subject to federal guidelines.\n",
      "   This gives the federal government the power to inﬂuence the states. For exam- ple, in the 1970s, the federal government wanted to lower highway speed limits to reduce energy consumption. Rather than simply legislate a lower speed limit, the federal government threatened to with- hold money for road projects from states that did not themselves lower the speed limit in their states. In many cases, the states must also partially fund the pro- grams to qualify for federal funds.\n",
      "   A local government is chartered ac- cording to its state’s constitution. Just as the policies enacted by the state govern- ment must not conﬂict with federal law, a local government is subject to the legal environment created by the state’s consti- tution and statutes.\n",

Tribes have their own rule-making bodies and judicial systems to settle disputes arising on tribal lands or between tribal members.

      "   One signiﬁcant difference between the United States and some other major democracies is the selection and role of the head of government. In parliamen- tary systems, the head  of  government is a prime minister selected from the parliament, and is typically the leader of the majority political party or coalition. The prime minister appoints a  cabinet of ministers often consisting of other\n",

This results in clearly deﬁned political lines in the United States, with- out the formal need for coalition-building often required to create a ruling major-  ity in a parliamentary system. One factor contributing to the two-party system in the United States is the single-member district system of electing Representa- tives. In some parliamentary systems, proportional representation is  used, which allows many parties to be repre- sented in parliament.\n",

Much of the difference is due to the social services and beneﬁts (such as health care and old-age pensions) that governments in some other nations pay for. In the United States, many of these services are delivered by the private sec- tor or are not funded to the same extent by the government, and thus are not counted in government expenditures.\n",

      "2. The bill is introduced in the Senate and/or House. It is assigned a number and its title and sponsors are published in the Congressional Record.\n",
      "3. The Parliamentarians  of  the  House and Senate assign the bill to the com- mittee with appropriate jurisdiction. The chair of the committee may then  assign the bill to the most appropriate subcom- mittee. It is important to note that the committee  and  subcommittee  chairs have a great deal of power  over  how  a bill assigned  to  them  is  considered.  If the chair opposes the legislation,  he  or she may simply not act on it.\n",
      "4. The subcommittee may hold hear- ings on the bill and invite testimony from public and private witnesses. Many witnesses are Executive Branch ofﬁcials, experts, or affected parties from trade associations, labor unions, academia, public interest groups, or the business community. Individuals may also make their views known by testifying, by pro- viding a written statement, or by allow-\n",

Usually, however, the subcom- mittees and committees in both bodies have an opportunity to hold hearings, and amend the bill. Related or identical legislation often proceeds through the House and Senate simultaneously.\n",
      "9. If a bill is passed in identical form by the House and Senate, it is delivered to the President. If there are differences between the House and Senate versions of the bill, a conference committee is appointed by the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House to resolve the differences. If the conferees are un- able to reach agreement, the legislation dies. If they do reach an agreement,\n",

First, federal judges are appointed for life, and they can be removed from ofﬁce only through impeachment and conviction by Con- gress of “Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.” Second, the Constitution provides that the compensa- tion of federal judges “shall not be dimin- ished during their Continuance in Ofﬁce,” which means that neither the President nor Congress can reduce the salary of a federal judge.

A succession of landmark cases was a driving force in     the expansion of rights for minorities and protections for defendants in criminal cases. Many of these, though controversial at the time, are now praised as enduring victories over injustice. The following are examples of some cases that had a lasting impact:\n",

Other top executive ofﬁcials who may be elected rather than appointed are the lieutenant governor, secretary of state, attorney general, comptroller, and mem- bers of various boards and commissions.

      "   Federal elections are held in Novem- ber of even-numbered years. Just as the President, Senators, and Representatives have overlapping constituencies, their terms also overlap.\n",
      "• All Representatives are elected every two years by the voters of the district they represent.\n",
      "• Senators serve six-year terms, with one- third of them up for election every even year. Senators are chosen in statewide elections and represent all residents of their states.\n",
      "• The President and Vice President are elected together every four years in a nationwide election.\n",
      "   The election process begins well in advance of the actual election as individu- als declare their candidacies for ofﬁce.\n",
      "In the congressional election process, if more than one candidate from the same party seeks the ofﬁce, a primary election is held to determine which candidate will be on the ballot in the general election.\n",
      "   The primary process for presidential elections  is  different  from  congressio- nal elections. Beginning in January and lasting through June of the election year, states hold presidential primaries or cau- cuses. The results of these ballots deter- mine how many delegates will represent each respective candidate at the national\n",
      "\n",
      "party nominating conventions, which are usually held in July or August. These po- litical conventions are where each party’s nominee is actually selected.\n",
      "   In the general election in November, Senators and Representatives are  elected by plurality vote—the candidate receiving the most votes wins, even if it is not a ma- jority. In presidential elections, each state  is allocated a number of electoral votes equal to the sum of U.S. Representatives and Senators for that state. The District of Columbia, though not a state, has three electoral votes.\n",
      "   The presidential candidate who wins the popular vote in a state “wins” that state’s electoral votes, usually in a winner- take-all manner. After elections in each state are certiﬁed, the electoral votes won by each candidate are counted. If a can- didate receives a majority of the electoral votes (at least 270 of the 538 total), he or she is declared the winner. If no candidate wins a majority of electoral votes, the U.S. House of Representatives chooses the winner, with each  state  delegation  hav- ing one vote. Because the President is not elected directly by the people, it is possi-  ble for a candidate to receive a plurality of the popular vote and yet lose the election.\n",

      "The then-Governor of Massachusetts Paul Cellucci addresses members of the Cato Institute, a Washington, D.C. think tank, 2001. Think tanks, groups of scholars who research and write on public policy, are one of many kinds of private organizations in the United States that seek to inﬂuence the government.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "   The U.S. system of government was designed to be deliberative, accessible by citizens, and open to a wide variety of opinions and interests. Just as the gov- ernment has evolved and grown over time, so too have the institutions that seek to inﬂuence the government.\n",
      "THE MEDIA\n",
      "   The media in the United States is con- trolled by the private sector and faces no political censorship by the government.\n",
      "There is a strong tradition of independent newspapers, magazines, television, radio,\n",
      "\n",
      "and other forms of media publicizing varying opinions, both critical and sup- portive of government policy.\n",
      "   The media serves at least three important functions in inﬂuencing pub- lic policy. First, policy makers are under constant scrutiny by the extensive media\n",
      "industry. Public ofﬁcials realize that almost anything they do or say—even in private\n",

      "public policy issues, thereby educating the public. Finally, the media provides a forum for publishers and broadcasters (and their readers and listeners) to present editorial opinions that may inﬂuence others. Many large newspapers, for example, endorse particular candidates for ofﬁce or publish guest articles favoring one policy over another.\n",
      "   By bringing the acts of public ofﬁcials to light, educating the public about the issues, and deliberately favoring certain candidates and policies, the media can inﬂuence policy directly or, by shaping public opinion, indirectly.\n",
      "\n",
      "SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS / NONGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (NGOs)\n",
      "   Special interest groups are private- sector organizations whose members share common interests or positions on public policy, and who pool their resourc- es with the intent of gaining a more prom- inent voice in policy debates. There are literally thousands of such groups repre- senting almost every conceivable interest.\n",
      "Some organizations have a long history of working towards a general goal, while\n",
      "others are formed temporarily to advocate for or against a speciﬁc policy proposal.\n",

      "   While some of these groups have a distinct partiality towards liberal or con- servative policies, many are highly re- spected as authoritative sources of study on matters that affect public policy. Some prominent think tanks with a long history of contributing to the public policy debate include the Brookings Institution, Heri- tage Foundation, Cato Institute, American Enterprise Institute, Center for Strategic and International Studies, and the Com- petitive Enterprise  Institute,  among others.\n",

These activities include writing to their elected ofﬁcials about particular policies, writing letters to the editor of their local newspaper, and appearing at hearings and other public functions where policy is debated.\n",

There are ways, however, for foreign gov- ernments to inﬂuence policy in the United States. Treaties, for example, become the law of the United States when ratiﬁed. In negotiating these treaties, foreign gov- ernments have inﬂuence over what will become U.S. law.\n",
